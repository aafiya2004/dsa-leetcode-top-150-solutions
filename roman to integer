        for i in range(len(s)):
            if i+1< len(s) and roman[s[i]] < roman[s[i+1]]:
                ans-=roman[s[i]]
            else:
                ans+=roman[s[i]]
        return ans
Explanation:
Given: array of romans
To do: It's corresponding integer
Step 1: define the values of Roman letters using dictionary
Step 2: If the current value of the roman letter is less than the next value, then the current value will be taken as (-) and subtracted with answer
Step 3: Otherwise the current value will be added with the already computed answer.
Step 4: The answer is called.
