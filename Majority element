class Solution:
    def majorityElement(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        nums.sort()
        n=len(nums)
        return nums[n//2]

Explanation:
Given:1 array
To do: print the element which is repeating majority times in that array
1) Sort the array in ascending order
2) compute using the formula nums[n//2] where n will be the length of the array.
This problem is solved in O(nlog n) time complexity as the array is sorted and then computed.
