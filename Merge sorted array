class Solution:
    def merge(self, nums1: List[int], m: int, nums2: List[int], n: int) -> None:
        for i in range(n):
            nums1.pop()
        nums1.extend(nums2)
        nums1.sort()

Explanation:
Given: 2 arrays nums1 and nums2 with their respective lengths m and n
The 2 arrays should be merged and stored into the 1st array(nums1)
the final array should be in ascending order
To solve:
1)remove the last elements from 1st array according to the length of the 2nd array using pop().
2)add the elements from the 2nd array into the 1st array using extend().
3)Sort the final array
